# Deta Jam

We're organizing a new sort of hackathon - it's **not going to be a ship and forget event**. You're not supposed to build something in 24 hours in attempt to win a prize.

At Deta, we build tools to help makers and hackers ship things - not for big, slow, rigid organizations. We like to think **we're building the side-project stack**. And our hackathon, the Deta Jam should reflect this vision.

So here's the pitch - we're holding a 2 week long event where we want you to ship your side project. Yes, the one you've been thinking about for a while, but never really got to building. Or the one you tried a while ago, failed and gave up on.

It's not going to be a hackathon for everyone. We're **accepting 30 people for our first run** - all we ask is that you have a vision for what you want to build. It can be something that'll make your life easier, or more fun, or even an internet business. Anything works!

We'll not leave you alone in the process of building - you'll be sharing a daily progress update with your peers, and build a community to **hold each other accountable**, and will always offer mentorship of any sort when you ask for it.

We'll sponsor your **hosting, database, and buy you a domain** to kick things off. We'll even support our 3 favorite projects with \$100, and get you going with some micro-runway!
